Live location travel map (Great Circle)

Luc de Wit made a live updated travel map. https://www.reddit.com/r/torncity/comments/1pew2h0/i_created_a_script_that_turns_the_boring_flight/
He only used straight lines between locations, my OCD could not cope with that. So I've made a version which uses a great circle map arc as a filght path.
